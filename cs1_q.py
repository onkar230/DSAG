An unsorted group of n elements are stored in the first n entries of a one dimensional array, indexed 1 to n. What is the order of complexity for an algorithm, which inserts an element into the array in the (n+1)th position?

O(1)

A sorted group of n elements are stored in the first n entries of a one dimensional array, indexed 1 to n. What is the order of complexity for an algorithm, which inserts an element into the sorted array in the correct position?


O(n)

Which statement describes the meaning of O( n)?


An algorithm operates in linear time


Five programmers have each developed a different algorithm to solve a given problem. The efficiency of their algorithms are given below. Determine which programmer has created the most efficient algorithm?

Programmer B - Efficiency of O(log2n)

What is the order of complexity (Big-O) of adding 1 to each element in a square two-dimensional array of integers of size n x n?


O(n2)

A program takes nearly 3 hours to process 1000 items, but it can process 10 items in a second, and 100 items in just under 2 minutes. Using Big O notation, estimate the performance of this program.
